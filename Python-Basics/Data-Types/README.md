## Data Types in Python

### What are Data Types?
Data types define the kind of value a variable can store and the operations that can be performed on it.  
Python is dynamically typed, meaning the data type is determined at runtime.

### Common Python Data Types

#### Numeric Types
- `int` – whole numbers
- `float` – decimal numbers
- `complex` – complex numbers

#### Text Type
- `str` – stores text or characters

#### Boolean Type
- `bool` – represents True or False

#### Sequence Types
- `list` – ordered and mutable
- `tuple` – ordered and immutable
- `range` – sequence of numbers

#### Mapping Type
- `dict` – stores key-value pairs

#### Set Types
- `set` – unordered collection of unique elements
- `frozenset` – immutable set

### Program Description
The Python program `data_types_demo.py` demonstrates the creation of different data types and prints their values along with their respective types using the `type()` function.
